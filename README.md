# Lipsum

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

# Horoscope

Gemine - with the moon hanging out in Leo and your gregarious third house this weekend, part of you wants to be out and about connecting with people and exploring the local scene. But due to planetary pivots on Sunday, there’s another side of you that could wants peace and quiet. As Uranus does a U-turn in Taurus and your restful, cathartic twelfth house early that day, you could become distracted by feelings that are bubbling up inside you. Seek privacy so you can process them instead of brushing them aside. That night, shadowy Pluto reverses out of Aquarius and returns to Capricorn and your intense, intimate eighth house for one final visit. Between now and November 19, you’ll have a chance to sift through—and make sense of—powerful emotions buried deep within. A strong psychological shift or sexual connection could be in the pipeline, so buckle up!
